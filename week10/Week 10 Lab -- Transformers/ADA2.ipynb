    "This notebook is the second of two lab notebooks that you will submit as part of your assessment for the Advanced Data Analytics unit. The notebook contains three sections:\n",
    "1. **Introducing Transformers:** This section introduces the Transformers library from HuggingFace, showing you how to use it to obtain contextualised embeddings from pretrained transformer models.\n",
    "2. **Classification with transformers:** Here we show you how to construct a neural network classifier using Transformers, and give you the task of applying it to irony detection in tweets.\n",
    "3. **OPTIONAL: More on Transformers:** Some pointers to other materials if you want to learn more about transformers, e.g., if using them in your summer project. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "These sections will contain tutorial-like instructions, as you have seen in previous text analytics labs. On completing these sections, the intended learning outcomes are that you will be able to...\n",
    "1. Use pretrained transformers to obtain contextualised word embeddings.\n",
    "1. Construct classifiers with pretrained transformers. \n",
    "1. Find documentation on pretrained models in the Transformers library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside each of these sections there are several **'To-do's**, which you must complete for your summative assessment. Your marks will be based on your answers to these to-dos. Please make sure to:\n",
    "1. Include the output of your code in the saved notebook. Plots and printed output should be visible without re-running the code. \n",
    "1. Include all code needed to generate your answers.\n",
    "1. Provide sufficient comments to understand how your method works.\n",
    "1. Write text in a cell in markdown format where a written answer is required. You can convert a cell to markdown format by pressing Escape-M. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some unmarked 'to-do's that are part of the tutorial to help you learn how to implement and use the methods studied here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Marking Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The coursework (both notebooks) is worth 30% of the unit in total. \n",
    "1. There is a total of 100 marks available for both lab notebooks. \n",
    "1. This notebook is worth 34 of those marks.\n",
    "1. The number of marks for each to-do out of 100 is shown alongside each to-do.\n",
    "1. For to-dos that require you to write code, a good solution would meet the following criteria (in order of importance):\n",
    "   1. Solves the task or answers the question asked in the to-do. This means, if the code cells in the notebook are executed in order, we will get the output shown in your notebook.\n",
    "   1. The code is easy to follow and does not contain unnecessary steps.\n",
    "   1. The comments show that you understand how your solution works.\n",
    "   1. A very good answer will also provide code that is computationally efficient but easy to read.\n",
    "1. You can use any suitable publicly available libraries. Unless the task explicitly asks you to implement something from scratch, there is no penalty for using libraries to implement some steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Support\n",
    "\n",
    "The main source of support will be during the remaining lab sessions (Fridays 2-5pm) for this unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The TAs and lecturer will help you with questions about the lectures, the code provided for you in this notebook, and general questions about the topics we cover. For the marked 'to-dos', they can only answer clarifying questions about what you have to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "Office hours: You can book office hours with Edwin on Tuesdays 3pm-5pm by sending him an email (edwin.simpson@bristol.ac.uk). If those times are not possible for you, please contact him by email to request an alternative. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Deadline\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook must be submitted along with the second notebook on Blackboard before **Wednesday 11th May at 13.00**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to zip up this notebook with the previous notebook into a single .zip file, which you will submit to Blackboard through the 'assessment, submission and feedback' link on the left sidebar. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please name your files like this:\n",
    "   * Name this notebook ADA2_<student_number>.ipynb\n",
    "   * Name the zip file <student_number>.zip\n",
    "   * Please don't use your name anywhere as we want to mark anonymously. "
